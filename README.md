Kafka Connect is a free, open-source component of Apache Kafka® that serves as a centralized data hub for simple data integration between databases, key-value stores, search indexes, and file systems. You can use Kafka Connect to stream data between Apache Kafka® and other data systems and quickly create connectors that move large data sets in and out of Kafka.

Benefits of Kafka Connect
Kafka Connect provides the following benefits:

Data-centric pipeline: Connect uses meaningful data abstractions to pull or push data to Kafka.

Flexibility and scalability: Connect runs with streaming and batch-oriented systems on a single node (standalone) or scaled to an organization-wide service (distributed).

Reusability and extensibility: Connect leverages existing connectors or extends them to fit your needs and provides lower time to production.
